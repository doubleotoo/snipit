Snippet Uploader
=================

This is a very concise tornado application that basically functions as a pastebin.
However, it has a few defining and unique characteristics.

*	 *Memorable URL's*
	 
    We use the wordnik API to generate a memorable URL, 
    not a random number sequence
*	 *Opensource (obviously)*
*	 *Automatic syntax highlighting*
*	 *Advanced and usable code editor, not a textarea*
	 
    We use CodeMirror, a popular JavaScript code editor with built in syntax highlighting and auto-indentation
*	 *Simple, streamlined user interface*

    Programmers are notorious for designing terrible interfaces, but we think we did a pretty good job with this one
*	*Significantly enhances your vocabulary*

    Since every upload is linked to a unique word, hopefully you'll learn some new terms to flaunt! :D
